# Api
# Geocoding API is a simple tool that we have developed to ease the search for locations while working with geographic names and coordinates.

Supporting API calls by geographical coordinates is the most accurate way to specify any location, that is why this method is integrated in all OpenWeather APIs. However, this way is not always suitable for all users.
Geocoding is the process of transformation of any location name into geographical coordinates, and the other way around (reverse geocoding). OpenWeatherâ€™s Geocoding API supports both the direct and reverse methods, working at the level of city names, areas and districts, countries and states:

- Direct geocoding converts the specified name of a location or zip/post code into the exact geographical coordinates;
- Reverse geocoding converts the geographical coordinates into the names of the nearby locations.
